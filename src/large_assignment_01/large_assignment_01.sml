(* 
 *  Type: `int * int * int -> bool`
 *  Description: The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of any 
 *               two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the 
 *               third side. This function should return true if the three 
 *               integers can make a triangle and false otherwise.

(*
 *  Type: `real * real * real -> bool`
 *  Description: The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum
 *               of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than
 *               or equal to the third side. This function should
 *               return true if the three real numbers can make a
 *               triangle and false otherwise.

(*
 *  Type: `int * 'a list -> 'a list`
 *  Description: Given an integer n and a list l, cycle n elements
 *               from the list to the end of the list. You can assume
 *               the input for n will be non-negative.
 *  Example: cycle(4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) â†’ [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
